    "The article is a storytelling exploration of the US gun deaths from 2012 to 2014 using Python and specifically Jupyter framework. The analysis uses two datasets: the guns.csv that shows gun deaths in the US from 2012 to 2014 and the second dataset, introduced much later, is the US census data of 1st April 2010 as census.csv . The guns.csv dataset came from FiveThirtyEight. I start off by exploring the guns.csv dataset."
